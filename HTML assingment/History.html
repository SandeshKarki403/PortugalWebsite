            <h2>History of Portugal National teams </h2>
            <p>The history of the Portugal national football team is a story of perseverance, 
               transformation, and eventual triumph. Established in 1914 under the Portuguese
               Football Federation, the team played its first official match in 1921 against 
               Spain. For much of the 20th century, Portugal remained on the fringes of
               international football, with few qualifications and limited success.
               Their first major breakthrough came in the 1966 FIFA World Cup,
                where the legendary Eusebio led the team to a third-place finish, 
               scoring nine goals and earning global recognition. However, the following
               decades were marked by inconsistency and missed opportunities, with Portugal
                failing to qualify for most major tournaments.</p>
                <p>
                    The tide began to turn in the 1990s with the emergence of the “Golden Generation,”
                     featuring stars like Luís Figo, Rui Costa, and Fernando Couto. This era saw Portugal
                    qualify for Euro 1996 and begin a streak of regular appearances in international competitions.
                     Despite promising squads, Portugal suffered heartbreaks, including a loss to France in Euro 2000 
                     and a shocking defeat to Greece in the final of Euro 2004, which they hosted. The team reached
                     the semifinals of the 2006 World Cup, their best performance since 1966, but again fell short of the title.

                    Portugal greatest achievement came in Euro 2016, when they defied expectations to win 
                    their first major international trophy. Led by Cristiano Ronaldo and coached by Fernando Santos, 
                    the team overcame early struggles in the group stage and defeated France in the final with a dramatic
                     extra-time goal by Éder. This victory marked a turning point, followed by another triumph in 2019 when
                    Portugal won the inaugural UEFA Nations League. With a blend of experienced veterans and emerging talents,
                    Portugal has continued to be a formidable force in world football, consistently qualifying for major tournaments
                    and maintaining a reputation for tactical discipline and technical brilliance. Today, the team stands as a symbol
                     of national pride and global competitiveness, with a legacy built on resilience and excellence.
