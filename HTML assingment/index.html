                <h2>Team Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Portugal national football team, commonly known as the Seleção das Quinas, 
                    is one of Europ most respected and successful sides, representing the Portuguese
                     Football Federation since its founding in 1914. Over the decades, Portugal has
                     produced legendary players such as Eusébio, Luís Figo, and Cristiano Ronaldo,
                     who have helped shape its reputation as a football powerhouse. 
                    The team breakthrough came with a third-place finish at the 1966 FIFA World Cup,
                     but its greatest triumph arrived in 2016 when Portugal won the UEFA
                      European Championship, defeating host France in the final.
                     They followed this success by claiming the inaugural UEFA Nations League 
                    title in 2019, further their place among the continents elite.
                       Known for their technical flair, creativity, and attacking style,
                      Portugal blends experienced stars with emerging talents, 
                     making them a consistent contender on the global stage. <hr>
